Guess The Number Game in FireMonkey Delphi Good morning, good afternoon, good evening dear Delphi developers! I'am Mo'minjon Abduraimov.

Today we will learn, "How to make Guessing the number game in FireMonkey Delphi".

A few days ago, i have created this game app using FireMonkey Delphi. It takes me 20minutes to create this game app.

This game app was built in FireMonkey Delphi. And designed for only Android Platform. This game app is open source and fully free. You can download the source code from GitHub.

In this open source game app, you can learn:

How to navigate forms.
How to make rich user interface (UI).
How to navigate Google AdMob ads.
How to open uniform resource locators (URL) in FireMonkey Delphi.
How to use TTabControl.
How to make standart Android actions.
How to load images from Android storage.
How to use Delphi FireMonkey Shape components (Bitmap property).
and others!
How the game works?

That is very simple. There are three difficulties:

Easy.
Medium.
Hard.
But there is only Easy mod. You can play only Easy mod.

In Easy mod, the system Randomize a number between 0 and 10.
Then user inputs a number and clicks Check button.

If that result is matched then game displays about that. If result is less than result or high, then game app display about that.
